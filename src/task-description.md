4. If needed you can mix CSS framework with a component library
5. Try to host your site on Firebase (netlifiy host will need extra configuration)
6. If you have any issues with hosting or Github push, please join the Github and deploy a related support session

### What to submit:

1. Your Github repository
2. Your live website link

### Some Guidelines:

1. Do not waste much time on the website idea. Just spend 30 minutes deciding, find a sample website, and start working on it.
2. Do not waste much time finding the right image. You can always start with a simple idea. Make the website and then add different images.
3. Don't look at the overall task list. Just take one task at a time and do it. Once that is done, pick the next task. If you got stuck on one task, move on to the next task.
4. Stay calm, think and work sequentially. You will make it.
